I just recently got back from my trip to Germany for my Senior Design Project. Myself and another Electrical Engineering student have been working with two EE students from Germany for the past several months, and we travelled to Germany from March 3rd-17th to meet them, see Germany, and work on the project. It was a really great experience, and we all had a lot of fun. We might've gotten a little bit of work done too. Below are some pictures from the trip.

We spent most of our time in Schweinfurt, but we also visited Bamberg, Berlin, Bad Neustadt, and Munich. We got to visit their university, go to the Deutsch Museum in Munich, and even drive some really fancy tractors (thanks, Felix's parents!). We ate a lot of really good food and had a great time all around. Thanks Andreas and Felix for being such great hosts!
