Test
At the moment, I'm a college student double majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering at Auburn University. I'll be graduating in May, and after that I plan to work as part of the wireless cybersecurity team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory while I work on getting a master's in Artificial Intelligence.
